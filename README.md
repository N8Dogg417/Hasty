My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of the Video Chat powered by Daily.co as well as an assiociated analytics dashboard for users and admin. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities.

• Developed a user video chat dashboard page with React, leveraging the Daily.co API to provide a user-friendly data visualization tool. Users can easily view and analyze important metrics to make informed decisions.
 
•  Integrated a custom video chat interface powered by Daily.co by utilizing React.js, C#, .NET framework, and RESTful APIs.

• Implemented dynamic and interactive data visualization in the front end using React apex charts, including tables, graphs, and charts, to provide users with clear and concise information.
 
• Utilized third-party libraries in React such as Yup, Formik, SweetAlerts, React-Bootstrap, and Toastrs in order to provide an enhanced and engaging UX.
 
• Designed and built a RESTful API using the .NET framework, which included creating an API authentication system to securely retrieve analytics data on the server-side. 
 
• Created an video chat service and integrated it with C# and .NET. This service provides other developers on the team with an efficient way to handle video functionality site wide. 
 
• Tested API functionality using Postman to ensure that endpoints and requests were working properly to avoid potential bugs or errors before deployment. 
 
• Generated data tables and stored procedures to handle data manipulation throughout the application by using joins, FK relationships, UDTs, Batch inserts, and sub-queries for best clarity and efficiency for stored information. 

• Used Git and GitHub for source control and repo management.
